# Applying Functional Principles in C# - Customer Management App
A sample application for [Applying Functional Principles in C# 6](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/csharp-applying-functional-principles) using Microsoft .NET 6. 
The same course is available [here](https://github.com/vkhorikov/FuntionalPrinciplesCsharp). 
App was migrated, from .NET Framework 4.5 to .NET 6 (education purposes).

This application, is intended to be a learning tool, for applying Functional Principle practices. 
It incorporates several of these practices in a way that is simple and easy to understand:
- Refactoring to an Immutable Architecture
- Refactoring Away from Exceptions
- Avoiding Primitive Obsession
- Avoiding Nulls with the Maybe Type
- Handling Failures and Input Errors in a Functional Way
